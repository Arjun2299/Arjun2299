 Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark   
-	Captured packets using Wireshark which was generated form the specific web application and those packets were saved into in the pcap file to further analyse the traffic generated form that webpage  
-	Analysed HTTP, and HTTPs packets to derive the unencrypted data flowing over the network such as IP address, username, password and other sensitive data 
-	Performed different attacks such as interrupting traffic, delaying traffic, relaying the packets to client address and using the captured packets to login to web portal 
-	Reported and documented the analysis done over the web application also documented the possible solutions to fix the data leakage
